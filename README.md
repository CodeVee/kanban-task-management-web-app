## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Learned how to use Tailwind and Customize it for my project. Also Learned the usage of the drag
 and drop component from Angular Material. Finally used a Mobile-first workflow.


### Continued development

Using it to lear Node.js and Express.js by making it a full-stack project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Very useful in finding utility classes.
